<h2>Five unique lakes that have something exceptional to them</h2>
<p>Most lakes in Finland are in Lakeland – obviously – but they can be found in every part of the country. These are five unique lakes that have something exceptional to them; how they were formed, the role they play in culture or the clear water that flows in them.</p>

<h3>Lappajärvi Lake – a meteorite-made natural wonder</h3>
<p>Lappajärvi lake in the coast and archipelago region in South Ostrobothnia is Europe’s largest crater lake. The 23 km-wide crater was formed after a meteorite hit the site more than 70 million years ago. Impactite, a rare rock created by the impact of the meteorite, can be found around the lake and on its islands, and even today the region still experiences shallow earthquakes as the asteroid collision still has impact on the subsoil of the lake – but don’t worry, the tremors are mostly detectable by seismographs only. At the Kivitippu Meteorite Centre, visitors can explore the events that led to the creation of the crater lake. The lake’s surroundings offer a wide range of outdoor activities, from nature trails to fat-biking and canoeing. For tips and rentals, visit the hotel Kivitippu. You can also take a Lappajärvi cruise on the M/S Veannetar.</p>
